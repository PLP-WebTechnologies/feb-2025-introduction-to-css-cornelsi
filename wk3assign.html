        <p>
            I love You, Lord<br>
            For Your mercy never fails me<br>
            All my days, I've been held in Your hands<br>
            From the moment that I wake up<br>
            Until I lay my head<br>
            Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chorus">
            <p>
                'Cause all my life You have been faithful<br>
                And all my life You have been so, so good<br>
                With every breath that I am able<br>
                Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
            </p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>
                I love Your voice<br>
                You have led me through the fire<br>
                In darkest night You are close like no other<br>
                I've known You as a Father<br>
                I've known You as a Friend<br>
                And I have lived in the goodness of God, yeah

         <div class="stanza">

                Your goodness is running after, it's running after me<br>
                Your goodness is running after, it's running after me<br>
                With my life laid down, I surrendered now<br>
                I give You everything, oh Lord<br>
                Your goodness is running after, it's running after me<br>
                Your goodness is running after, it's running after me (oh yeah, oh yeah)<br>
                Your goodness is running after, it's running after me<br>
                With my life laid down, I surrendered now<br>
                I give You everything<br>
                Your goodness is running after, it keeps running after me
